## üìä Vulnerability Findings

| Vulnerability                                             | IP Address      | Port/Protocol | Severity | CVSS Score |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| DNS Cache Snooping Vulnerability (UDP) - Active Check     | 192.168.190.2    | 53/udp         | Medium   | 5.0        |
| TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure                     | 192.168.190.1    | General/tcp    | Low      | 2.6        |

## ü©∫ Vulnerability Details

### 1. DNS Cache Snooping (UDP)
- **Description**: Allows an attacker to determine if certain domains have been resolved recently ‚Äî useful for reconnaissance.
- **Impact**: Privacy and information disclosure.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Disable recursion for external queries on DNS servers.
  - Restrict access to DNS services via firewall rules.

---

### 2. TCP Timestamps Disclosure
- **Description**: TCP timestamps can reveal system uptime, which may help attackers in fingerprinting and exploitation timing.
- **Impact**: Low-risk but contributes to broader attack vectors.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Disable TCP timestamps via:
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps=0
    ```
  - To make permanent, add this to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
    ```bash
    net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0
    ```
  - Apply with: `sudo sysctl -p`
